SCRIPTDIR=$(readlink -f $(dirname $0))

# Commandline parameters:
#
# INDIR: root directory from which the input pcap.gz files are read.
# See the README.txt for the specification of this directory.
#
# OUTDIR: the directory to which the output pcap files are written.
# This directory will be created, if necessary.  WARNING: you usually
# DON'T want this to be the same as INDIR -- things will work if you,
# do, but cleaning up any problems will be more complicated

# Script parameters:
#
# CONCURRENCY is the number of concurrent filtering processes to use.
# If you have a system with fast CPUs and fast drives, you can increase
# this, but for my old system (with fairly sluggish disks) unzipping
# more than two pcap files at the same time saturates the bandwidth
# available to the file system.  If INDIR and OUTDIR are on SSDs and
# you have a fast multicore CPU, CONCURRENCY=8 is plausible.
#
# LOADTEST is the name of the directory where the load-test tools
# are installed.  The only element of load-test used by this script
# is pcap_weave.
